# Occupied-column movement

## Rule

Only an occupied column can trigger a turn and descent. Movement to the right
uses the rightmost occupied column; movement to the left uses the leftmost.
One enemy anywhere in a column is sufficient. Color, special state, and row do
not affect whether that column is occupied. Gaps between occupied columns do
not matter for the horizontal boundary calculation.

Contact uses the outer edge of the logical cell, not sprite pixels or shields.
This keeps movement stable when art changes or shield/animation visuals grow.
The current scene uses an unrotated grid with positive horizontal scale.

Horizontal speed is now proportional to the live Green count: 0.03 world units
per second per Green, multiplied by level scaling. Zero Greens means no motion.
The numerical timing examples below assume one Green at level-one speed.
`UseGreenDashes` retains the previous nonzero-base-speed mode, disabled by default.

## Geometry

The playfield edges are x = -3 and x = +3, shared with player wrapping and the
visible border. Six logical columns are spaced 0.75 world units apart. Their
local centers are:

    localCenter(column) = (column - 2.5) * 0.75
    occupiedLeft  = gridX + localCenter(firstOccupied) - 0.375
    occupiedRight = gridX + localCenter(lastOccupied)  + 0.375

The implementation converts cell edges through the grid transform, rather than
assuming its origin remains fixed. At unit scale, a level 1-6 row occupies
columns 0-4, spans 3.75 units, and reaches the right edge when gridX is +1.5.
At speed 0.03 units per second, that means 50 seconds to the first right contact
from center and 75 seconds between opposite contacts if both outer columns remain
occupied. A level 7+ row occupies columns 0-5, spans 4.5 units, and reaches the
right edge when gridX is +0.75.

If column 4 is empty, the rightmost possible occupied column becomes 3. It must
travel another 0.75 units before touching the right border. At the default
speed, this adds 25 seconds. Clearing the last enemy in column 3 adds another
column's worth of travel. These are geometric consequences, not timers.

## Movement update

`GridModel.OccupiedColumns` scans live enemy records to find the first and last
occupied columns. `EnemyGrid.OccupiedHorizontalBounds` converts their outer
edges into world coordinates. Neither operation caches occupancy, so removals
are reflected on the next movement update.

`EnemyGridMovement.Tick` spends frame time up to each border contact and
recomputes speed after the spawn callback changes the Green count.
`AdvanceDistance` handles each segment against the distance to the relevant border:

1. If the grid is empty, do not move, turn, or request descent.
2. If the frame cannot reach the border, move normally in the current direction.
3. Otherwise, move exactly to contact, reverse direction, and emit `SweepEnded`.
4. The spawner handles descent and new rows, stopping descent at occupied capacity.
5. Recompute bounds and spend any leftover travel against the new state.

Recomputing after the callback matters: spawning can expand the occupied range
and relabel columns. A single slow frame can cross multiple boundaries, but each
event corresponds to an actual occupied-edge contact. Disabling movement during
game over stops the loop immediately. Resetting the sweep increments a version
counter, preventing unused travel from leaking into a reset fleet. A stationary
fleet or a formation occupying the entire field width remains still.

This replaces both the old reflected-offset formula and its time-based turn
counter. Direction is now explicit state, and there is no Travel Distance
setting.

## Fitting a new row

A sparse fleet can travel beyond the position where a full five-column row fits.
Simply spawning columns 0-4 at that origin would put new enemies offscreen.
Snapping the origin back alone would make survivors jump sideways.

`EnemyGrid.AlignForNewRow` instead shifts column labels and the origin by equal
and opposite amounts. `GridModel.TryShiftColumns` validates every destination
before rebuilding its cell lookup. All surviving enemies receive the same
column shift, so their adjacency, identity, color, and relative shape survive.

Example: only columns 0-3 remain occupied when a five-wide row reaches the
right wall. The grid origin is x = 2.25. Before spawning:

- Shift all survivor column indices right by one.
- Move the grid origin left by 0.75 to x = 1.5.
- Rebuild each survivor's local position from its new column.

A survivor formerly in column 3 was at 2.25 + 0.375 = 2.625. After relabeling it
is in column 4 at 1.5 + 1.125 = 2.625. Its horizontal screen position is unchanged.
It then descends one row normally. The level 1-6 row fills columns 0-4 entirely
inside the border; level 7+ rows fill columns 0-5. Left-edge contacts use the
mirrored operation.

The spawner checks the bottom boundary before relabeling or descending, so an
occupied bottom row blocks additional descent and rows without ending the run.
Horizontal sweeping continues. The grid has eleven rows: the final row is at
player height, while the original ten retain their positions. Only body contact
between a live player and an enemy in that final row triggers game over.

Horizontal fleet movement and player movement test the whole traveled segment
against stable body bounds, stopping at the earliest contact. Wrapping is split
into movement to the edge and movement from the opposite edge, not a sweep
through the field. Arrival by descent or Purple summon also checks contact.
Shields, tongues and detached death effects are not enemy bodies. Pause defers
contact checks; the absent player during recovery cannot collide, but missile
invulnerability after reappearing does not prevent game over from body contact.
Batch refill still restores the original grid position and starts moving right.

## Verification

The editor suite covers clearing a leading column immediately before contact,
empty columns on both sides, occupancy in a lower row, empty fleets, zero speed,
30/60/120-frame-per-second simulation versus a long frame, callback-driven stop
and reset, and no-room-to-move protection. Spawn tests cover both directions and
verify survivor positions, identities, occupancy, and full-row bounds.

The Play mode suite additionally removes all but one occupied column, verifies
that the previous full-row boundary no longer causes a descent, and continues
to real contact. It checks exactly one new row, preserved survivor positions,
and all spawned cells inside the border. Existing matching, retreat, abilities,
refill, game-over, and restart checks also pass.
